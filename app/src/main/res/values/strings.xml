    <string name="history">Visakhapatnam History</string>

    <string name="vizagHistory">Visakhapatnam history goes back to the sixth century BC. Its name can be found in Hindu and Buddhist texts that date back to ancient times. Vizag, as Visakhapatnam is often referred to, has been mentioned by Panini and Katyayana in their writings of the fourth century BC. The city was also a part of the Kalinga kingdom, which was later conquered by the great Emperor, Ashoka.</string>
    <string name="vizagHistory1">The city of Visakhapatnam has been named after Visakha, the god of valor and war. Visakha is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati and is also the ruler of Mars. According to local legend, the city was named Visakhapatnam by an Andhra king between the 9th and 11th century. It is said that the king stopped for a rest in this place on his way to Varanasi, or Benaras. He was so captivated by the beauty of this place that he decided to build a temple in honor of his family deity Visakha. However, according to archaeological records, Vizag was built between the 11th and 12th century by Kulottunga of the Cholas.</string>
    <string name="vizagHistory2">According to history of Visakhapatnam, the city has been ruled by a number of dynasties over the years. Some of the dynasties which had ruled over Visakhapatnam are the Kalingas, the Chankyas, the Rajahmundry Reddy kings, the Cholas and the Golkonda Nawabs. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Vizag was under the rule of the Mughals. As Visakhapatnam is located on the shores of Bay of Bengal, it was an important center of trading. Dutch, French and other European merchants used the port for trading in ivory, tobacco, muslin and other products. Towards the end of the 18th century, Visakhapatnam came under the control of the French.</string>
    <string name="vizagHistory3">Since India gained independence in 1947, Visakhapatnam has become one of the leading ports of the country. Vizag is also the seat of the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy.</string>
